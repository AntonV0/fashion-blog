## Project Outline
This is my first project on the Full Stack Codecademy course! It is a very basic website that introduced me to foundational HTML syntax.
## What I Learned
  - The basic HTML structure
  - Use of common tags
  - Sourcing images from links
  - Links to other websites
  - Basic Markdown syntax to write this README

*Please note, as these projects are relatively small, most will only have 2 commits. The first commit is always the starter code provided by Codecademy.*
